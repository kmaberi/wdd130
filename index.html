Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Kenneth Maberi, and I'm a student at BYU-Idaho, currently pursuing a course in Web Fundamentals. This page serves as a digital portfolio where I showcase the projects and skills I’ve developed throughout my studies. As I progress in web development, I aim to document my journey, share my learning experiences, and demonstrate the projects I’ve worked on. Whether you're here to explore my work, learn more about my experiences, or simply connect, this site reflects my passion for web development and my continuous growth in the field. I hope you find it informative and engaging!">

                diversity. It's
                home to the endangered Mountain Gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, offering visitors a unique
                opportunity

                the
                vast
