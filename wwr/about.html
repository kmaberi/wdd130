            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2013, Whitewater Rafting Co. began as a small family-run business with a simple yet powerful
                vision: to share
                the thrill of whitewater rafting with adventurers of all experience levels. What started as a passion
                project with just
                a couple of rafts and a handful of guides has grown into a premier outdoor adventure company, recognized
                for its
                commitment to safety, excellence, and unforgettable experiences.</p>
            <p>Our story began on the banks of the Colorado River, where our founders—avid rafters and nature lovers—saw
                an opportunity
                to combine their love for the outdoors with a business dedicated to adventure tourism. They believed
                that rafting was
                more than just a sport; it was a way to connect with nature, escape the daily grind, and challenge
                oneself in a
                breathtaking environment.

                With just a few rafts, a dream, and a commitment to providing top-tier experiences, our company took
                off. In the early
                days, trips were small, word spread through local outdoor communities, and customers returned year after
                year, bringing
                friends and family along.</p>
